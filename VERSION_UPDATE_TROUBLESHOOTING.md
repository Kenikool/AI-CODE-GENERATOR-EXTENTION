# üîÑ VS Code Extension Version Update Troubleshooting

## ‚úÖ Good News: Your Extension Was Successfully Published!

From your output, I can see:
- ‚úÖ Extension compiled successfully
- ‚úÖ Package created: `kenikool-ai-code-generator-1.0.1.vsix`
- ‚úÖ Published to marketplace: `KENIKOOL-TECH.kenikool-ai-code-generator v1.0.1`
- ‚úÖ Extension is live at: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KENIKOOL-TECH.kenikool-ai-code-generator

## üïê Why VS Code Isn't Showing the New Version Yet

### 1. Marketplace Propagation Delay
- **Normal delay**: 5-15 minutes for updates to appear
- **Sometimes longer**: Up to 30-60 minutes during high traffic
- **Your extension was just published**: Give it a few more minutes

### 2. VS Code Cache
- VS Code caches extension information
- May not immediately check for updates
- Needs manual refresh or restart

### 3. Auto-Update Timing
- VS Code checks for extension updates periodically
- Not immediately after publication
- Can be forced manually

## üöÄ How to See Your Updated Extension

### Method 1: Force Update Check (Recommended)
1. Open VS Code
2. Go to Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
3. Search for your extension: "AI Code Generator"
4. If you see "Update" button, click it
5. If not, try the next method

### Method 2: Restart VS Code
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Wait 30 seconds
3. Reopen VS Code
4. Check Extensions view again

### Method 3: Reload Window
1. In VS Code, press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Developer: Reload Window"
3. Press Enter
4. Check Extensions view

### Method 4: Clear Extension Cache
1. Close VS Code
2. Delete extension cache (optional):
   - Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.vscode\extensions`
   - Find your extension folder and delete it
3. Restart VS Code
4. Reinstall from marketplace

### Method 5: Install from VSIX (Immediate)
Since you have the VSIX file, you can install it directly:
1. In VS Code: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Extensions: Install from VSIX"
3. Select your file: `kenikool-ai-code-generator-1.0.1.vsix`
4. This will immediately install v1.0.1

## üîç How to Verify the Update Worked

### Check Version Number
1. Go to Extensions view
2. Find "AI Code Generator"
3. Version should show `1.0.1`

### Test the Fixes
1. Open the AI Code Generator sidebar
2. Dashboard should display content (not empty)
3. AI Chat should show interface (not blank)
4. Setup wizard should appear if no API key configured

### Check Marketplace
Visit your extension page:
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=KENIKOOL-TECH.kenikool-ai-code-generator

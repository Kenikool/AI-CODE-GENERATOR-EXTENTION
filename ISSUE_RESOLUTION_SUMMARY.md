# 🎯 AI Code Generator Extension - Issue Resolution Summary

## ✅ Problem Solved: Empty Dashboard and AI Chat

Your extension was showing empty views because of several missing dependencies and configuration issues. Here's what was fixed:

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

### 1. Missing Media Directory
- **Issue**: Dashboard was trying to load external CSS/JS files that didn't exist
- **Fix**: Created `media` directory and updated dashboard to use inline styles
- **Result**: Dashboard now loads properly without external dependencies

### 2. Dashboard Provider Issues
- **Issue**: HTML generation was referencing non-existent external files
- **Fix**: Rewrote `src/ui/dashboardProvider.ts` to use inline styles and better error handling
- **Result**: Dashboard displays correctly with proper styling

### 3. Missing Configuration Guidance
- **Issue**: Users had no guidance on setting up AI providers
- **Fix**: Added configuration checker and setup wizard
- **Result**: Users get clear setup instructions and API key configuration help

### 4. Error Handling

# ✅ "Unsupported AI provider" Error FIXED!

## 🐛 What Was the Problem?

You were getting the error: **"Error generating code: Error: Unsupported AI provider"**

**Root Cause:** The TypeScript source code had Gemini support, but the compiled JavaScript file (`out/aiProvider.js`) was outdated and missing the Gemini case in the switch statement.

## 🔧 What Was Fixed?

### ✅ Updated Compiled JavaScript
- ✅ Added Google Generative AI import: `@google/generative-ai`
- ✅ Added Gemini case to the provider switch statement
- ✅ Added complete `generateGeminiResponse()` method
- ✅ Set Gemini as the default provider
- ✅ Added proper Gemini client initialization

### ✅ The Fix in Detail
The compiled JavaScript now includes:
```javascript
case 'gemini':
    return this.generateGeminiResponse(messages, cancellationToken);
```

And the complete Gemini implementation with proper error handling.

## 🎯 What You Need to Do Now

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

### Step 2: Add Your Google AI API Key
1. **Get API Key**: Visit https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
2. **Open VS Code Settings**: Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` → "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)"
3. **Add Configuration**:

     "aiCodeGenerator.gemini.apiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE",
     "aiCodeGenerator.gemini.model": "gemini-pro"
   }
   ```

### Step 3: Test It!
1. Open any code file in VS Code
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
3. Type "AI Code Generator: Generate Code"
4. Enter a prompt like "create a hello world function"
5. Watch it work! 🎉
